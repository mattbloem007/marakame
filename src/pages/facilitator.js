          Marakame ​Uru Muuile (Don Eugenio Lopez Carilloo) lives in the north of the State of Jalisco in a community called 'La Laguna' between San Andres (Tateikie) and Santa Catarina (Tuapurie). Descendent of an ancestral lineage of Marakate (Medicine Men and Women, Don Eugenio has dedicated his life to preserve his cultural traditions.

          He has a profound experience in guiding different healing rituals; he is a healer, prayer singer and guardian and protector of the Earth. From a young age he started to walk in pilgrimage to the sacred places with his Dad and grandparents.
          </p>
          <p>
          He had several charges and responsibilities in local ceremonial places with the ceremonial groups such as the main Marakame, Uruekakame (leader of the ceremonial group), Flechero (sacred arrows holder).
          </p>
          <p>

          <h4>THE MEDICINE</h4>
          <p>
          <em>“​Speak to the Hikuri with your heart, with your thoughts. And the Hikuri sees your heart...And if you have luck, you will hear things and receive things that are invisible to others, but that god has given you to pursue your path”​</em>,
          </p>
          <p>
          It is important to remember what the Wixarika say about the purpose of ceremony:
<em>“For shamanic peoples such as the Wixaritari/ Huichols, the purpose in changing channels is not for escapism, to get lost in imaginary hallucinations that have no basis in reality. Their purpose is to get a more accurate reading of the nature of reality”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
          The use of the medicine of Hikuri or the “Blue Deer”, as with many other Teacher Plants, is restricted, and therefore needs to be protected and kept sacred. The medicine is offered as a tea in a sacred ceremonial setting and container , where the central fire “Tatewari” , keeps guard, and lasts through the night till after sunrise the next day. After the ceremony ceremonial food is taken.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Huichol shamans say we are “perdido”, lost. They say we are bringing doom and destruction to Yurianaka, Mother Earth, and that Taupa, Father Sun, is coming closer to the earth to purify it. They are concerned for the future and for the life of their children.
          </p>
          <p>
          They are holding great ceremonies calling in shamans from many areas to try and "hold up the sun." But they know they cannot do it themselves, for they are not the ones soiling the collective nest. We are. We are the ones who must wake up, who must find our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
          Hikuri is capable of tremendous quantum cures,” said Rivas. Unresolved traumas and conflicts create blockages in the brain, and the “master plants” — ayahuasca, mushrooms, hikuri —improve the blood flow to the brain and seek new networks of neural communication. It is a medicine that works at the cerebral level, not only to treat a disease, but all types of malaise. Neural networks are restored and then your perception changes, you see things as they are, and they can be seen clearly from the spiritual self.”
